# RSAW-MCDM
GAMS implementation of the Relative Simple Additive Weighting (RSAW)  method for multi-criteria decision making under uncertain criterion weights, with application to portfolio optimization on the Tehran Stock Exchange.
# RSAW Bound Estimation under Uncertain Weights

This repository contains the GAMS implementation of the Relative Simple Additive Weighting (RSAW) estimation framework under interval uncertainty in criteria weights.
The code provides lower and upper bounds for RSAW scores, enabling robust ranking of alternatives in multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) when the exact importance of criteria is not known.

📌 Overview

The RSAW method extends SAW by incorporating relative scaling between alternatives, and this repository provides:

RSAW lower-bound estimation,

RSAW upper-bound estimation,

implementation of all optimization models in GAMS.

A real case study on the Tehran Stock Exchange (TSE) illustrates the effectiveness of RSAW in portfolio ranking under uncertain weights.
